# Speiseplan Tray
This is a small tray application for the [Speiseplan](https://studentenwerk.sh/de/mensen-in-luebeck?ort=3&mensa=8#mensaplan) of the [Studierendenwerk Schleswig Holstein](https://studentenwerk.sh). It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) to run as a tray application. \
It builds on top of this [Speiseplan API](https://speiseplan.mcloud.digital/).
## Features
- ðŸ’» Tray application for Windows
- ðŸ“… Shows the menu for the current day
- ðŸ¥¬ Lets you filter by food type
## Local Setup
The following steps will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have Node.js and npm installed:

1. Clone the repo with 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Importantus/speiseplan-tray.git
```
2. Change into the directory and install dependencies
```bash
cd speiseplan-tray
npm install
```
3. Start the local development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Install and use [gitmoji](#gitmoji) to commit

### Build
Run `npm run build` to build the app for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `release/` directory.

### Gitmoji

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to make commits more expressive.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install -g gitmoji-cli
```

#### Initialize as git hook

```bash
gitmoji -i
```
### Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
